# REACT NOTES

---

## Declarative vs Imperative

### Imperative:

- With _Imperative_ coding, we instruct what has to be done at each and every step. Like we do with the vanilla JS coding (we modify the DOM manually).

### Declarative:

- With _Declarative_ coding, we just provide data and how we want to display the data. The framework then takes care of rendering the DOM effectively.

## React Concepts

- Don't touch the DOM. React will do it.
- Build websites into smaller blocks/components which are re-usable.
- One way data flow (towards the child nodes but not the other way)
- React can handle only the UI, rest should be handled by us like how the data has to be fetched.

## Important things to remember while developing a React Application

1. Decide on Components.
2. Decide the State and where it lives.
3. What changes when state changes.
